                        <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundational language for creating and structuring web content. It uses tags to define elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, and images, and includes attributes for additional details. An HTML document typically starts with a `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, followed by the `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` sections, where the latter contains the visible content. Browsers interpret HTML to render text and media on web pages, and it works alongside CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity.</p>
                        <p>HTML, created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991, is the basic language used for building web pages. The first version allowed for simple document structuring and linking. Over time, HTML has been updated to include more features and improvements. Major updates include HTML 2.0 in 1995, HTML 4.01 in 1999, and XHTML in the early 2000s. The latest version, HTML5, introduced in 2014, added new capabilities for multimedia and web applications, making modern websites more dynamic and interactive.</p>

                        <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to control the appearance of HTML elements on a web page. It works by applying styles to these elements through selectors, which target specific elements or groups of elements. Styles are defined using properties and values, such as setting text color or font size. CSS rules consist of a selector and a block of declarations, and the cascade and specificity determine how conflicting styles are resolved, with more specific or later-defined rules taking precedence. Additionally, styles can be inherited from parent to child elements, allowing for consistent design across a site.</p>
                        <p>CSS was introduced in 1996 by the W3C to separate web design from content. The first version, CSS1, offered basic styling options. CSS2, released in 1998, added more features like positioning and media queries. CSS3, starting in the early 2000s, introduced advanced tools for layouts, animations, and responsive design. Over time, CSS has become crucial for creating modern, interactive websites.</p>
